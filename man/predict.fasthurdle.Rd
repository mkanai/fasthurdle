\usage{
\method{predict}{fasthurdle}(
  object,
  newdata,
  type = c("response", "prob", "count", "zero"),
  na.action = na.pass,
  at = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted model object of class "fasthurdle".}

\item{newdata}{An optional data frame containing the variables needed for prediction.}

\item{type}{Character string specifying the type of prediction. "response" returns the
expected value, "prob" returns the probability mass function, "count" returns the
expected value of the count component, and "zero" returns the expected value of the
zero hurdle component.}

\item{na.action}{Function determining what to do with missing values in newdata.}

\item{at}{Optional vector of counts for which to compute probabilities.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently ignored).}
}
\value{
A vector or matrix of predictions.
}
\description{
Predict values from a fitted hurdle model.
