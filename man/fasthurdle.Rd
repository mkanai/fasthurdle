\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula expression of the form y ~ x | z where y is the response
and x and z are regressor variables for the count and zero components, respectively.
If the | operator is not specified, the same regressors are used for both components.}

\item{data}{An optional data frame containing the variables in the model.}

\item{subset}{An optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be used.}

\item{na.action}{A function which indicates what should happen when the data contain NAs.}

\item{weights}{An optional vector of weights to be used in the fitting process.}

\item{offset}{An optional offset for the count model. Can also be specified via the offset
argument in the formula.}

\item{dist}{Character string specifying the count distribution. Currently, "poisson",
"negbin" (negative binomial), and "geometric" are supported.}

\item{zero.dist}{Character string specifying the zero hurdle distribution. Currently,
"binomial", "poisson", "negbin" (negative binomial), and "geometric" are supported.}

\item{link}{Character string specifying the link function for the binomial zero hurdle model.
Currently, "logit", "probit", "cloglog", "cauchit", and "log" are supported.}

\item{control}{A list of control parameters passed to the optimizer. See \code{\link{hurdle.control}}.}

\item{model}{Logical. If TRUE, the model frame is included in the returned object.}

\item{y}{Logical. If TRUE, the response vector is included in the returned object.}

\item{x}{Logical. If TRUE, the model matrices are included in the returned object.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link{hurdle.control}}.}
}
\value{
An object of class "fasthurdle" representing the fitted model.

\description{
Fits hurdle regression models for count data. The hurdle model combines a count data model
(such as Poisson, negative binomial, or geometric) for positive counts with a hurdle component
that models the zero counts. This implementation uses C++ for the core computations, making it
faster than the original pscl::hurdle implementation.
}
\details{
The hurdle model combines two components: a truncated count component for positive counts
and a zero hurdle component that models the zeros. The probability mass function is given by:

\deqn{f(y) = \begin{cases}
f_{zero}(0) & \text{if } y = 0 \\
(1 - f_{zero}(0)) \cdot \frac{f_{count}(y)}{1 - f_{count}(0)} & \text{if } y > 0
\end{cases}}

where \eqn{f_{zero}} is the zero hurdle distribution and \eqn{f_{count}} is the count distribution.
